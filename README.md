Short Term Rental Nightly Fee Suggester

After reviewing Airbnb and Vacasa pricing data in various cities, 
I was quite interested in developing a program to determine what the future suggested nightly rent should be
in a given city. I was able to find two zillow databases on major US cities and a correlation between the House Price and 
rental rates. From there I was able to create a prediction based on a linear regression of this data. After adding in various 
cost of ownership expenses and finding the average time period that these properties are booked per month, I was able to get
within a reasonable range of suggested values by the Airbnb become a host calculator.
